# Elis Troyanovsky's GitHub Profile

## About Me

I am a Computer Science student based in Tel Aviv with a strong foundation in algorithms, data structures, and object-oriented programming as well as application development.

My main focus is understanding how software works close to the hardware level — from memory management and algorithmic design in C, to x86 assembly programming.  
Alongside this, I enjoy building practical applications, including Java-based projects, and applying clean architecture principles in higher-level systems.

I enjoy solving algorithmic problems and designing clean, modular systems in Java, while maintaining an interest in how programs execute and manage resources.
